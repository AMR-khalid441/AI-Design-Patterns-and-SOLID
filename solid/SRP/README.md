# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) — ML Pipeline

This module demonstrates the difference between violating and applying SRP using a small ML pipeline (Iris dataset + a simple MLP).

- violation: a single "god class" that loads data, trains, evaluates, logs, and saves models.
- solution: small components with one reason to change, composed via a pipeline.

Navigate to `docs/01-quickstart.md` to run each example.
